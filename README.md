<h3>Hello there 👋</h3>

I'm Benjamin Calef, Magento Developer since 2016, I spend some of my time to provide generic solutions to help Magento developer community and to share my experience as a end to end developer working for final customer. I work directly for retailers since 2016 and I'm freelancer since 2019, my Magento 2 certification was issued on 2018.

I often say that I'm lucky because my job is also my hobby.<br>
My current and future project shared on GitHub are free and will remain so.
