<h3>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</h3>

I'm Benjamin Calef, Magento Developer since 2016, I spend some of my time to provide generic solutions to help Magento developer community and to share my experience as a end to end developer working for final customer. I work for retailers directly since 2016 and I'm a freelancer since 2019.

I often say that I'm lucky because my job is also my hobby.<br>
My current and future project shared on GitHub are free and will remain so.
