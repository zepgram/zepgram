<h3>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</h3>

I'm Benjamin Calef, Magento Developer since 2016, I spend some of my time to provide generic solutions to help the Magento community and hoping that will be flourishing to the ecosystem.
I'm fully dedicated to web development and especially to e-commerce. 

I often say that I'm lucky because my job is also my hobby.<br>
My current and future project shared on GitHub are free. You can add a star to support me!
